we learned about FT

**install terraform:**

* we are downloading terraform and install. works on mac also

  ```text

  wget "https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/${TF_VERSION}/terraform_${ver}_linux_amd64.zip"
  unzip terraform_*_linux_amd64.zip
  sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin
  chmod +XXX /usr/local/bin/terraform

**terraform commands:**

there are 5 main commands we are going to play with:

* init  - initials the "state" file. it is also perform generic model stracture checks. 
* plan  - unify all referent terraform file, with the ARGS, and composes those into in-memory model, than compares that into the model read from the state file. each and every step it decides to perform displied.
* apply - performs the plan operations if a plan file exist. if not performs plan than applies those changes on the AWS enviroment.
* destroy - performs resources removal from the enviroment, as apear in the state file
* graph - displays the resources in the model as graph. usefull in case of displaying model.

other commands remember to note:

* import - imports an existing resource into the state file.
