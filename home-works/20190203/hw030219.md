## Lesson Notes:

given following jenkins file definition, you need to perform the following tasks:

* Merge following stages of our Jenkins pipeline: 
  1. Dockerfile creation
  2. Docker build
* Create following stages:
  1. Create K8s depoyment \(yaml with external service\)
  2. "Ansible deployment"
* **a bonus**:
  1. under "Jenkins pipelines" directory, you will find some files starting with "Jenkinsfile\*":
     1. what they does? describe in psudu code \(may in hebrew\)
     2. what the diffrences between the syntax?

**Important notes:**

* Please use comments explaining your choice, comments are made with '//' chars on the beginning of the line.
* please note, you may find 3 types of syntaxes used, ask yourself, why? and when you will use them.  

**resources to use:** 1. [Jenkins pipeline book link](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) 2. [Jenkins pipeline syntax](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/) 3. [jenkins declerative workflow syntax link](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-basic-steps)
